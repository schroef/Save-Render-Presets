# Save Render Presets

This addon allows the user to save render presets per engine. This allows for very easy of switchin between different render qualities and thus no more repetive actions are needed.

A new approach getting engine attributes(setting values), thanks to Daniel Engler (['Eevee-presets'](https://github.com/danielenger/Eevee-Presets/)), makes this addon work on all Blender version without a hustle.
